\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Magnetic Resonance Imaging is commonly used by medical community to safely and non-invasively probe the structure and function of human bodies. Images generated using MRI have a profound impact both in clinical and research fields. MRI has scan phase (data acquisition) and image reconstruction phase. Short scan time can increase scanner throughput and reduce patient discomfort, which tends to mitigate motion-related artifacts. High resolution of the image is preferable. Short scan time and high resolution conflict with each other if sampling with the Cartesian trajectory in k-space on a uniform grid, which allows image reconstruction to be performed quickly and efficiently. However, the reconstruction of non-Cartesian trajectory sampling data is faster and less sensitive to imaging artifacts caused by non-Cartesian trajectories, but it increases computation significantly~\cite{stone2008accelerating}. The computation for MRI-Q matrix is an important algorithm used for image reconstruction with non-Cartesian trajectory sampling~\cite{stratton2012parboil}.

\subsection{Motivation}
Heterogeneous systems architecture is the future trend. Hardware specialization can bring order-of-magnitude more energy efficiency.Designing an accelerator for computing MRI-Q matrix through ESP is a good way to learn ESP design methodology.
