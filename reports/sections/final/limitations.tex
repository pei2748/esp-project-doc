\section{Limitations of The Work}

We don't compare our acceleration result with the state-of-the-art MRI image
recustruction performance since we only accelerate one part of the iamge
reconstruction. The whole image recustruction of non-Cartician scanning contains
three steps: computing Q-matrix, computing the vector $\mathbf{F}^{H}
\mathbf{d}$, and finding the image iteratively via a conjugate gradient linear
solver. The first two steps are very similiar.~\cite{stone2008accelerating}
Since our accelerator only accelerate the first step, we can't evaluate the
reconstructed image quality and the performance with other works. Also, we don't
know the error tolerance of the first step.
