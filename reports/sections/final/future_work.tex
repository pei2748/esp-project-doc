\section{Potential Future Work}
\begin{itemize}

\item Design the same set of accelerators with Vivado HLS C/C++ through ESP for
  the MRI-Q matrix computation. Compare the latency and area performance between
  the generated RTLs through two different design flows.

\item Design accelerators to compute the second step mentioned in Section 6.

\end{itemize}
