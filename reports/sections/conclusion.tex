\section{Conclusion}

In this project, I have designed a set of accelerators using ESP to compute the
Q matrix for MRI image reconstruction. Any arbitrary input data sizes can find
an accelerator to work with. The accelerators are tested on the FPGA through
both bare-metal application and Linux application. I have also done different
levels of design space exploration. Customizing PLM designs and reducing the
fixed point precision can reduce both area and latency. Loop-unrolling and
loop-pipelining in the main computation-intensive loop can reduce latency
proportionally when compute kernel is dominating the whole procedure.
